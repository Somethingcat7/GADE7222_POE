Following the death of Panoptes, Infinite Mind, Osiris built the Sundial in an attempt to undo Saint-14’s death.
15 His attempts at changing Saint-14’s fate were unsuccessful, as he could never find the correct moment at which to save him.
16 However, the Guardian was able to find Saint-14 just after the Martyr Mind had taken his Light;
 with their help, Saint-14 was able to defeat the Mind and survive the encounter.
17 Following his defeat of the Martyr Mind, Saint-14 emerged from the Infinite Forest and left for the City.18
